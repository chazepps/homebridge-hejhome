<h1 align="center">Homebridge Hejhome Plugin</h1>

The Hejhome plugin facilitates seamless integration of Hejhome devices with HomeKit.

### Supported Devices List

Currently supported devices are listed below. I am working based on the products I own, so if you want to add a device, feel free to send a PR or request it in an issue, and I will try to purchase and work on it.
